These are taken from my initial Ratings metrics ideas for the ranking system for the World Broadband Map.
I'm gonna asterisk the stuff that could apply to rating fair practice.

Rankings consist of 3 factors
Speed (higher is better). For cable speed, measure in peak and offpeak times
* Caps/unlimited. (unlimited is best, caps start at light red and grow redder as they get lower), do a top caps chart
* Also don't forget about throttling
Availability/Competition. (2+ more is better, 2 is enough?) Wholesale availability is best
Regulatory Bodies ? any power to regulate?
* Speed of installation
Enter if you have NO internet access
DSL is weird, we do need to take every location because of distance
Cable, required peak and offpeak metrics
IF we do wireless, we record signal bars in a location, also do a speedtest.

This is a working model of the World Broadband Foundation's open specification for broadband internet access. This specification will act as a template for internet service providers to offer fair practice.
